#WARNING

You found my experimental shelf. Welcome to hell! Actually, it's not so bad if you don't mind documentation that hasn't been written yet :) Keep in mind that these aren't part of Houdini officially until I have them pulled into the main repository: https://github.com/sideeffects/GameDevelopmentShelf

The tools here are prototypes and may or may not function. Particuarly the ones in the "Game Development Experimental" shelf. Now, these won't `rm -rfv /` or install a rootkit, however they could very well crash Houdini. Feel free to download and learn from these!

#Game Development Shelf

This is a series of tools geared towards assisting Houdini users with a variety of tasks for game development. 

##Instructions

Copy the contents of this folder (/toolbar) into the following folders depending on your operating system:

Windows
C:\Users\[username]\Documents\houdini[ver#]\toolbar

OSX
/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/houdini/[ver#]/toolbar

##Activating the Shelf
01. Looking towards the very right of one of the shelves, click the little triangle pointing downwards
02. Click Shelf Sets
03. Click Game Development

##Saving its location
01. At the top menu, click Windows
02. Desktop
03. Save Current Desktop

Keep in mind, that will override the "Build" desktop. If you want to create a new desktop, click "Save Current Desktop As...".
